    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Jake DiPina and I am a Computer Science Major at the University of Rhode Island. I have lived in Rhode Island my whole life and I enjoy almost anything to do with the outdoors. Some of my biggest hobbies include playing basketball, and hiking. I also like hanging out with friends, watching movies, and making music on my laptop. I started my URI experience as a Kinesiology major, but soon realized that my interest was in computers and technology. My career goal is to enter the tech field and hopefully get into web development.</p>
