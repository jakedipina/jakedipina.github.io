    <h1>Final Project</h1>
        <p> For me and my partners final project, we made a point and click hide and seek game. The game consists of 4 levels, all unique from one another. To play the game, the user must find various khan image characters that are hidden in each level. Once the player finds the required number of characters, they are able to progress to the next level. After beating the game, the player is brought to a "victory" screen. From there, they can either return to the home page, or re-visit one of the levels. </p>
